'''
Point Operations Module

The purpose of this module is to provide tools for computing poitn cluster distances and relations.
These allow for the identification and prediction of the positions of reference points on the model.

TODO:
-implement trimmed median algorithm on findCentralPoint()
-generalize findClosest() to allow for specific axis and axis directions. Potentially separate this into a
    diferent version of the function
-implement an identification function for a set of points based on a fixed model
-provide proper documentation to functions
